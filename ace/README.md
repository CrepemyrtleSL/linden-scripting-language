## Ace Editor

Here you can find the syntax grammar, syntax highlighting and snippet files for the [Linden Scripting Language (LSL)](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal) of [Second Life](https://www.secondlife.com) for the [Ace Editor](http://ace.c9.io/) which can also be found on Github under [ajaxorg/ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace).

For maintenance reasons all files here are LSL related only.
